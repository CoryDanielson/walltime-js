By narrowing it down to just `northamerica` you could save 300k, adding gzip compression could get you down as low as 16k.\r\n\r\nThis project uses [node js](http://nodejs.org) and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org); go and install them if you don't have them.\r\n\r\nTo build all the data for all the time zone files\r\n\r\n    cake data\r\n\r\nTo build data for `northamerica` only\r\n\r\n    cake -f northamerica data\r\n\r\nTo build data for `northamerica` and `europe`\r\n\r\n    cake -f northamerica -f europe data\r\n\r\nTo build data for `America/Chicago` only\r\n\r\n    cake -f northamerica -z America/Chicago data\r\n\r\nTo build individual data files for each time zone\r\n\r\n    cake individual\r\n\r\nBy default the files are saved to `./client/walltime.js` etc.\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nTo get setup\r\n\r\n    # Clone the repo\r\n    git clone https://github.com/sproutsocial/walltime-js.git\r\n    # Install the dependencies\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\nTo run tests\r\n\r\n    cake test\r\n\r\nTo make new tests create a new spec coffee file in the test directory.\r\n"}
